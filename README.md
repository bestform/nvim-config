# bestform's ðŸ’¤ LazyVim config

This is my current nvim config. Some values are system specific for me and the whole thing is in constant motion.

Feel free to get inspired by it but I would not recommend cloning it one to one as it is highly personal and some things will not work out of the box on any system
