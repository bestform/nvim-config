# bestform's 💤 LazyVim config

This is my current nvim config. Some values are system specific for me and the whole thing is in constant motion.

Feel free to get inspired by it but I would not recommend cloning it one to one as it is highly personal and some things will not work out of the box on any system

## Dependencies

Those are the tools you should have installed on your system for this config to work properly

- a nerd font configured for your terminal
- lazygit
- fzf
- ripgrep
- lua (+ luajit, luarocks)
- nodejs

Languages (you can disable the support for those in the config if you don't need them)
- golang
- rust

## Optional

I highly recommend using neovim in combination with tmux and a nice terminal like ghostty

## My current font

The font I am currently using is font-maple-mono-normal. You can install it using homebrew.
Another font I really like is JetBrains Mono. 
Both are free.
